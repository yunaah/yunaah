        <h3>And that's it</h3>
        <p>That’s the simple story of how I got here—studying in TI USU and now already in my fourth semester. 
            Do I regret choosing this path? <i>Well, most of the time.</i> Even so, there are still many things I’m grateful for, despite how tough the journey has been.

            But hey, if my mother not asked me to choose computer-related major, you wouldn’t be able to access this website—or access my <a href= https://github.com/yunaah>GitHub!</a>
            I believe everything is part of God’s plan, so it’s okay! I know, we will survive ❤️
