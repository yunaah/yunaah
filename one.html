        <h3>It was a shiny day</h3>
        <p>As a final-year student, everyone is busy choosing their dream major and university—and so am I. 
            I rememberd, it was after school, when I went to my mom and shared all my plan with her. 
            But all of sudden, the shiny afternoon just changed like a storm—though in reality, 
            the storm was inside me, because my mom didn’t approve of my choice.
